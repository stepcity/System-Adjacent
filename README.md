# Cream Adjacent:
### A Cream revival for programmers.
##### This is a Work in Progress. Expect changes whenever I feel like it.
Cream was a font used by Apple and Xerox on prototype Macintosh computers and the Smalltalk-80 environment. I recently found a copy of the font in a reasonably modern font format, but it doesn't work well for programming because it's not monospaced. So I present to you: Cream Adjacent, a monospaced font based off Cream available as both bitmap and TrueType formats!

I've done my best to remain reasonably accurate given the limitations of a monospaced font. However, I have made some changes where I preferred a certain style. I created and edited this with BitsNPicas.

Here's a screenshot:

### Some planned additions (to replace the hex characters):
Currently, my major dreams for this font are to add the special Smalltalk characters and various mathematical symbols. However, I may instead opt for pseudographical characters (or maybe do both, depending on how much creativity I have :p ). Either way, I'll be departing from the realm of what was in the original Cream font, so my stylistic decisions may be questionable. I'll do my best to keep it consistent, though!
