# Cream Adjacent
### A Cream revival for programmers.
##### This is a Work in Progress. Expect changes whenever I feel like it.
Cream was a font used by Apple and Xerox on prototype Macintosh computers and the Smalltalk-80 environment. I recently found a copy of the font in a reasonably modern font format, but it doesn't work well for programming because it's not monospaced. So I present to you: Cream Adjacent, a monospaced font based off Cream available as both bitmap and TrueType formats!

I've done my best to remain reasonably accurate given the limitations of a monospaced font. However, I have made some changes where I preferred a certain style. I created and edited this with BitsNPicas.

Here's a screenshot:
